				h1.t-center Flight-mode on!
				| It’s an eight to nine hours flight from Stockholm to New York. We plan to depart from Stockholm on the 13th of June, as soon as the exams have ended and we will be away for almost three weeks. The goal of the trip is to visit at least one university, one company and to experience other cultures abroad as specified in the course plan. The different cities we will be visiting have been chosen by the members of the project, with the help of four experts in travel: our travel group. The trip starts in New York and from there we will take a train to Boston. From Boston, we fly to Seattle and then we will wrap it up in San Francisco.
