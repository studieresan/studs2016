				h2 We are interested in you
				p Ask a first year Computer Science student where they want to work after they have graduated. The question is daunting and hard to answer. What interests you when you start studying at KTH might be completely different from what you want to work with when you are close to finishing your studies.

				h2 We are motivated to work
				p At KTH, students spend five years to gain as much knowledge as possible. It is truly an opportunity and we are grateful for it. Five years, however, is a long time to spent in the classroom. Studs is a project consisting of 28 students who are close to graduate.
				br
				| Motivated to put their knowledge to use.
