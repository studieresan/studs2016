				h1 Studs for students
				| Studs is a project within the Computer Science faculty at KTH, where a group of students get the chance to meet relevant companies and go on a study tour. The project is a course called AI2151 and is worth 15hp. The course officially runs during the spring, but requires attendance the whole year. A good goal for you as a student is to establish a network with the companies involved. Also, you want to get the experience of how it is to carry out a larger project.
				br
				br
				| You have to be at the end of your education and have achieved a minimum of 120hp after the autumn. You must also have the possibility to take a 15hp course during the spring. Basic Swedish communication skills are required since most of the companies are located in Stockholm. An academic level of writing in Swedish is not necessary however since the website and report will be written in English.
				h2 Applying
				| Applications to Studs opens when the project leaders are elected. This is usually done on the last faculty meeting of the study year.
